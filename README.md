### MaskDetection ###

### Mask Detection System ###
### Introduction ###
```This repository contains code for a Mask Detection System that can be used for detecting whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The system consists of three main components: training a mask detection model, applying it to images, and applying it to a video stream.```

### Prerequisites ###
```Before using the Mask Detection System, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:```

```Python 3.10```

```Required Python packages (you can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt)```

### Getting Started ###
### Training the Model
1) Gather your dataset and organize it into two categories: "with_mask" and "without_mask."
2) Place the images in the corresponding directories within the dataset folder.
3) Open and run the mask_detector.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to train the model. You can modify the parameters like initial learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size as needed.

### Detecting Masks in Images ###
1) Use the detect_mask_image.py script to detect masks in individual images.
2) Run the script with the following command:
arduino
3) Copy code
```python detect_mask_image.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg```

### Detecting Masks in a Video Stream ###
1) Prepare your video stream (e.g., using a webcam or video file).
2) Run the mask_detector_video.py script to detect masks in the video stream.

### Dependencies ###
```Make sure you have the following Python packages installed, as specified in the requirements.txt file:```

1) numpy
2) pandas
3) seaborn
4) Werkzeug>=2.1.2
5) Flask>=2.1.2
